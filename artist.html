                <p class = "descriptionPara">Born in 1946, Autodidact, involved in painting since childhood<br><br>
                    Works with Oil & Acrylic in a unique style, using vivid colors, great strength of expression and creativity <br><br>
                    There's a great emphasis on colors, forms and movements. Behind every painting one feels the underlying drawing that animates the work. The exposed artwork makes it possible to note an ambiguity in the language, a contrast between two superimposed universes. However with another glance, the form takes its own rights, the invisible structures at the beginning are made suddenly clear <br><br>
                    The objective is to create a tangible reflection of his sense of observation on the canvas<br><br>
                    Winner of multiple awards, his paintings are part of private and public collections</p>
